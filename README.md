# 🚦 Smart Traffic Control and Violation Detection using YOLO

This project is a smart traffic management system that uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect traffic violations such as signal jumping, wrong-way driving, overspeeding, and helmet violations. It aims to automate traffic monitoring and help enforce traffic laws effectively.

## 🔍 Features

- 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Classification using YOLOv8
- 🚦 Red Light Violation Detection
- 🔄 Wrong-Way Driving Detection
- 🪖 Helmet Detection for Two-Wheeler Riders
- 🏎️ Speed Detection based on Frame Analysis
- 📸 Automatic Snapshot Capturing of Violations
- 🗃️ Logging Violations with Timestamp and Type
- 🔢 Number Plate Detection Integration (optional)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV (Image & Video Processing)
- Python
- Flask (backend)
- HTML-CSS-JS (GUI or frontend)
